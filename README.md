# Vat Sentinel RimWorld Mod

Vat Sentinel targets RimWorld 1.6 and enforces configurable biological age limits for pawns in vat-growing pods, automatically ejecting them at birth and age three while paving the way for future tactical enhancements like nutrition expansion and integrated backup power.

## Status

Development is in the planning phase. See `Design.md` and `TODO.md` for the current roadmap.
